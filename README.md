Trello clone to practice my javascript OOP and Webpack modularisation. I learnt so much from working through this project!
There a few more features I would've liked to add (like deleting boards, moving tasks between boards, moving boards in different order) but thought I learnt as much as I could with this project and wanted to move onto something different.
