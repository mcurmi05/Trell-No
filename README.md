Trello clone to practice my javascript OOP and Webpack modularisation. I learnt so much from working through this project!
I also ended up adding a saving feature which meant I learnt to use the localStorage API and working with JSON files to stringify and parse information which was cool.

There a few more features I would've liked to add but thought I learnt as much as I could with this project and wanted to move onto something different.
